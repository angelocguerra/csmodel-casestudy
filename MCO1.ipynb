The data contains information about each track and its qualities, including the song artist, year it was released, popularity rate, and various characteristics. The dataset takes advantage of Spotify's huge collection of music to create a useful resource which could help those who want to statistically assess and analyze the platform's top hits from the past two decades."

The data was then extracted from these playlists and Koverha collected it using the `Spotipy` library for Python.\n",
